Mining is one of the most dangerous job in the world,
in which more than 7,000 miners die every year due to hazardous gas. 
To rectify this we built a prototype "Walsh hat" which is a smart mining helmet with attached spectacles & ear plugs.
This prototype use LoRa module  for wireless transmission of data during any hazardous gas detected by MQ sensors and
alert both the miners and the control unit present outside mining industry.
Thus our project aims to save the lives of miners.
